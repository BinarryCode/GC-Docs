# Class Guide System
This is part of the class guide system that the mod uses; the functionality is the same at least. <br>
Please note that the class descriptions are not finished!

# How to use

`ClassDefFunc.py` is the main file that handles initializing array data and saving it to a JSON file, everything else is pretty much for the array.

If you would like to use this for something like a Discord Bot, you can have it read data in the JSON file (and 'autocorrect' when needed). Check [the included example file](https://github.com/BinarryCode/GC-Docs/blob/main/ClassGuides/read_classguide_example.py) for reference.
