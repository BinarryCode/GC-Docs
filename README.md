# Grand Classes Documentation

This is a Github repository that serves to document mod-specific features. <br>
Later I will implement some tools for assisting with making classes, but the main focus is [the wiki](https://github.com/BinarryCode/GC-Docs/wiki).

If you would like additional help, join [the server](https://discord.gg/VTP698cvcZ) (recommended), or [make an issue](https://github.com/BinarryCode/GC-Docs/issues).
